# Slider

In this section, we'll cover the main options of the main slider which contains the items

<Canvas of={GalleryStories.SliderExample}/>


The slider navigates through items using scrolling mechanism, it can be scrolled using the mouse wheel, touchpad on desktop or gestures on touch devices.

### Slide using mouse drag

The slider can be scrolled using mouse drag which requires hammerjs

> Sliding using mouse drag is optional, the gallery doesn't depend on hammerjs
> This feature is turned on by default when hammerjs is loaded in the app.
> You can turn off this feature by adding `mouseSlidingDisabled` attribute.

**Example**

```html
`<ng-gallery mouseSlidingDisabled />`
```


### Orientation

There are two choices for the gallery orientation `horizontal` and `vertical`, the default is `horizontal`.

**Example of a vertical orientation**

### Loading strategy

There are 3 choices for loading strategy of the main slider

- `default` renders only the active item, the previous item and the next item
- `lazy`: renders only the active item
- `preload` renders all the items, this option is required for `thumbAutoSize` is enabled

**Note**

> `preload` should be chosen if `itemAutoSize` is turned on

Sets the object-fit style applied on items' images

### Scroll behavior

There are two distinct navigation modes to choose from:

- **Smooth:** When you opt for the `smooth` mode which is the default, the gallery will smoothly scroll to the desired item,
with the scrolling duration determined by the `slidingDuration`.
- **Auto:** If you select the `auto` mode, the gallery will instantaneously transition to the desired item without any intermediate scrolling.

**Example**

### Autosize feature

When Use `autosize` attribute is set, it allows each thumbnail to fit its content size.


**Example**

You can turn on this feature like `<gallery autosize loadingStrategy="preload" loadingAttr="eager"/>

- In `horizontal` slide direction, item's width will automatically fit its content width.
- In `vertical` slide direction, item's height will automatically fit its content height.
