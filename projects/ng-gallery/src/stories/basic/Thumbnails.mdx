# Gallery Thumbnails

Thumbnails are an integral part of the gallery component, offering multiple customization options for appearance and behavior.



## Displaying thumbnails

To display thumbnails, add the following attribute:

```html
<gallery thumbs />
```


## Thumbnail position

There are 4 positioning choices are available for thumbnails: `top`, `left`, `bottom` and `right`.

The chosen position also dictates the slide direction: horizontal for `top` and `bottom`, and vertical for `left` and `right`.

## Customizing thumbnail size

Thumbnails can be resized using the `thumbWidth` and `thumbHeight` inputs:

- For `top` or `bottom` positions, `thumbHeight` determines the height of the thumbnails' slider.
- For `left` or `right` positions, `thumbWidth` determines the width of the thumbnails' slider.


## Automatic thumbnail sizing

The `thumbAutosize` attribute enables automatic thumbnail sizing, ensuring each thumbnail fits its content size.

- In `top` or `bottom` positions, the width of each thumbnail adjusts to its content.
- In `left` or `right` positions, the height of each thumbnail adjusts to its content.

## Disabling thumbnail clicks

To prevent navigating to new items by clicking on thumbnails, use the following attribute:

```html
<gallery disableThumbs />
```



## Detaching thumbnails

Typically, thumbnails adjust to centralize the active item. To disable this behavior `detachThumbs` as follows:

<Canvas of={GalleryStories.ThumbDetachedExample}/>



## Centralized thumbnails

By default, the active thumbnail is centrally positioned in the slider. However, if it's located at the beginning or end, it remains in place. To enforce centralization, utilize the `thumbView` attribute:

<Canvas of={GalleryStories.ThumbViewExample}/>
